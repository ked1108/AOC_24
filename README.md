![image](aoc.jpeg)

Welcome to my solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)! ðŸŒŸ This repository contains my Rust implementations for the daily programming puzzles released throughout December.

## ðŸ“š About Advent of Code
Advent of Code (AoC) is an annual series of programming challenges created by [Eric Wastl](https://adventofcode.com/about). Each day from December 1st to 25th features a new two-part puzzle, testing problem-solving skills and creativity.

## ðŸš€ Running Solutions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ked1108/AOC_24.git
   cd AOC_24
   ```

2. Navigate to the day's solution directory:
   ```bash
   cd dayX
   ```

3. Run the program using Cargo:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```
4. Navigate to the directory and place in your `input.txt` there:
    ```bash
    ./dayX
    ```

4. (Optional) Run tests:
   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```

## ðŸ›  Tools and Technologies
- **Language**: Rust
- **Build System**: Cargo
- **Testing**: Built-in Rust test framework
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub
- **Boilerplate Generation**: Custom Script
